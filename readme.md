# SQLFluff Online

![Lint and Test](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/sqlfluff-online/workflows/Lint%20and%20Test/badge.svg)

[Fluff](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank/sqlfluff) is a SQL formatter that I like a lot. 
I built this app because I often want to format one-off, adhoc sql that isn't even worth saving to a file.

You can use the application on [Heroku](https://sqlfluff-online.herokuapp.com/).
